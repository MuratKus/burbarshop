# Implement Professional Design System

Based on the design guidelines in our CLAUDE.md file, implement a sophisticated art gallery-style design system.

## Steps:
1. **Color System**: Implement the sage green, cream, and coral color palette as CSS custom properties in tailwind.config.js
2. **Typography**: Set up Playfair Display for headings and Inter for body text with proper font loading
3. **Component Library**: Create professional buttons, cards, and form components using shadcn/ui
4. **Layout System**: Build responsive layouts with proper spacing and hierarchy
5. **Admin Interface**: Create Etsy-style dark sidebar navigation for admin pages
6. **Product Showcase**: Design elegant product cards with hover effects and image optimization
7. **Image Optimization**: Implement high-quality image display with proper ratios using next/image

## Design Requirements:
- Follow the sophisticated, minimalist aesthetic from reference screenshots
- Use the specified sage/coral color palette consistently
- Implement smooth animations and hover effects throughout
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design with proper breakpoints
- Create dark admin interface with light content areas
- Maintain high-quality image display with consistent aspect ratios

## Output:
- Complete design system with all components documented
- Updated tailwind.config.js with custom design tokens
- Professional page layouts for homepage, shop, admin, and checkout
- Component library with TypeScript interfaces
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
