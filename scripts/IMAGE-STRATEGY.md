# Image Storage Strategy for Burbar Shop

## Current Status
- Images imported as direct Etsy CDN links
- 24 products with external image dependencies
- High quality (1000x1000px) images from etsystatic.com

## Recommended Approaches

### 1. Download & Store Locally âœ… (This script)
```bash
npm run images:download
```
- **Pros**: Full control, fast loading, no external dependencies
- **Cons**: Storage costs, need image optimization pipeline
- **Storage**: ~/public/uploads/products/

### 2. Use Vercel Blob Storage
```bash
npm install @vercel/blob
```
- **Pros**: Serverless, CDN, automatic optimization
- **Cons**: Vercel vendor lock-in, costs scale with usage
- **Best for**: Production deployments on Vercel

### 3. Use Cloudinary
```bash
npm install cloudinary
```
- **Pros**: Advanced image transformations, automatic optimization, CDN
- **Cons**: Additional service dependency, costs
- **Best for**: Professional e-commerce with many image variants

### 4. Use Next.js Image Optimization
```jsx
import Image from 'next/image'
<Image src="/uploads/products/image.jpg" width={500} height={500} />
```
- **Pros**: Built-in optimization, responsive images, lazy loading
- **Cons**: Requires local/blob storage first
- **Best for**: All approaches above

## Implementation Priority
1. âœ… Download images locally (this script)
2. ðŸ”„ Implement Next.js Image component
3. ðŸ”„ Add image compression (sharp)
4. ðŸ”„ Generate thumbnails for product grid
5. ðŸ”„ Consider CDN for production

## Performance Targets
- **Page Load**: <2s for product images
- **Image Size**: <200KB for product grid thumbnails
- **High Resolution**: <1MB for product detail view
- **Format**: WebP with JPEG fallback
