# Etsy API Access Issue & Solutions

## üö® The Problem

The Etsy API v3 requires **OAuth 2.0 authentication**, not just an API key. This means:

- ‚úÖ **API Key**: Only works for basic public data
- ‚ùå **Shop Data**: Requires OAuth flow (complex setup)
- ‚ùå **Private Data**: Needs user authorization

The OAuth setup requires:
1. Redirect URLs
2. User authorization flow
3. Token exchange
4. Token refresh handling

This is quite complex for a simple data extraction task.

## üí° Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Manual Data Input (Recommended)

Use the interactive script to input your product data:

```bash
npm run input:manual
```

**Features:**
- Interactive prompts for each product
- Template mode for batch input
- Automatic placeholder image generation
- Support for variants and reviews

**Example workflow:**
1. Open your Etsy shop in browser
2. Copy product information
3. Run the script and paste/type the data
4. Script creates structured database entries

### Option 2: Realistic Data Generator

Use the realistic data generator we created:

```bash
npm run db:realistic
```

**Benefits:**
- Instant results with realistic art shop data
- No API setup required
- Perfect for development and testing

### Option 3: Export from Etsy (If Available)

Check if Etsy provides data export options:
1. Go to your Etsy Shop Manager
2. Look for "Settings" ‚Üí "Options" ‚Üí "Download Data"
3. Export your listings as CSV
4. We can create a CSV importer script

### Option 4: Simple Copy-Paste Method

For quick testing, manually copy your product data:

```bash
# Example template format:
# Title | Description | Type | Price | Variants

Beautiful Landscape Print | Amazing mountain landscape | FINE_PRINT | 35.00 | A4:35:10,A3:50:5
Abstract Art Postcard | Colorful abstract design | POSTCARD | 12.00 | Standard:12:20
Riso Print Collection | Unique risograph artwork | RISO | 28.00 | A5:28:15,A4:35:10
```

## üîß OAuth Setup (Advanced)

If you really want to use the Etsy API, here's what you'd need:

### Step 1: OAuth App Setup
1. Go to https://www.etsy.com/developers/your-account
2. Create app with OAuth settings
3. Set redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/auth/etsy/callback`
4. Get client ID and client secret

### Step 2: OAuth Flow
1. User authorizes app
2. Get authorization code
3. Exchange for access token
4. Use token for API requests

### Step 3: Implementation
- Need OAuth 2.0 library
- Handle token refresh
- Manage user sessions
- Store tokens securely

This is overkill for simple data extraction!

## üéØ Recommendation

**For immediate use**: Use the realistic data generator or manual input tool.

**For production**: Consider building a simple admin interface where you can manually add products as you create them on Etsy.

**For development**: The realistic data generator provides everything you need for testing and development.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Option 1: Use realistic data (instant)
npm run db:realistic

# Option 2: Input your real data manually
npm run input:manual

# Option 3: Reset and use realistic data
npm run db:fresh
```

All of these will give you a fully functional database with product data that works perfectly with your app! üé®
